# Grid video player

Main purpose is to play same video file, which was processed with different algorithms like: AI tools, CV algorithms, filters, etc.

If we processed same video file in different ways, we need to compare them manually side by side sometimes.
And grid player allows us to do it.

# How to use

Click "File -> Open Multiple Videos" in menu bar.

Then select upto 4 videos in file dialog.

# Future plans

- Playing frame-by-frame for detailed comparison.
- Saving screenshots to store interesting moments for further analysis.
