# Grid video player

Its main purpose is to play same video file, which was processed with different algorithms like: AI tools, CV algorithms, filters, etc.

If we process same video in different ways, we need to compare results of its processing sometimes. And we need to do it manually to see the difference.
Grid video player allows us to do it.

# How to use

Click "File -> Open Multiple Videos" in menu bar.

Then select upto 4 videos in file dialog (you can also select only one video).

# Future plans

- Playing frame-by-frame for detailed comparison.
- Saving screenshots to store interesting moments for further analysis.
